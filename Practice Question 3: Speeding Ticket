# Test cases
print(speeding_ticket(60, False))  # Expected output: "No Ticket"
print(speeding_ticket(75, False)) # Expected output: "Small Ticket"
print(speeding_ticket(85, False))  # Expected output: "Big Ticket"
print(speeding_ticket(65, True)) # Expected output: "No Ticket"
print(speeding_ticket(85, True)) # Expected output: "Small Ticket"

#speed (integer): The driver's speed in mph (miles per hour).
#is_birthday (boolean): A flag indicating whether the driver is driving on their birthday.

#Instructions:
#- The function should return one of three strings based on the driver's speed: "No Ticket", "Small Ticket", or "Big Ticket".
#- If the driver's speed is 60 mph or less, they should receive "No Ticket". 
#- If the driver's speed is between 61 and 80 mph inclusive, they should receive a "Small Ticket".
#- If the driver's speed is 81 mph or more, they should receive a "Big Ticket".
#- On the driver's birthday, the speed limits for each ticket category are increased by 5 mph. For example, they can go up to 65 mph and still receive "No Ticket" if is_birthday is True.
