#Function Parameters:
#1. text (string): The text from which words will be filtered and counted.
#2. filter_words (list of strings): A list of words to be filtered out from the text.

#Instructions:
#- The function should filter out the words from the text that are present in the filter_words list. The comparison should be case-insensitive.
#- The function should return a dictionary. In this dictionary, the keys are the filtered words, and the values are the counts of how often these words appeared in the text.
#- The text may contain punctuation marks and spaces. Only whole words, separated by spaces or punctuation, should be considered.


# Test cases
print(word_filter_counter("Hello world, hello!", ["hello"]))
# Expected output: {'hello': 2}
print(word_filter_counter("The quick brown fox.", ["the"]))
# Expected output: {'the': 1}
print(word_filter_counter("Is this real life? Is this just fantasy?", ["is", "this", "just"]))
# Expected output: {'is': 2, 'this': 2, 'just': 1}
print(word_filter_counter("Do we see the big picture or just small details?", ["we", "the", "or"]))
# Expected output: {'we': 1, 'the': 1, 'or': 1}
